            <span className="font-bold">Introduction:</span> Halal Correct Spain
            is a highly recognized certification body and is already accredited
            by several accreditation/approval bodies, such as the Emirates
            International Accreditation Centre (EIAC), the Saudi Food and Drug
            Authority (SFDA) and the Ministry of Industry and Advanced
            Technology (MOIAT). This recognition allows you to expand your
            certification services through numerous companies in Germany and
            Europe. To briefly explain how Halal Correct Spain clients will
            manage certification costs, Halal Correct Spain has created this fee
            regulation system. This description seeks to maximize transparency
            in certification processes and procedures. Therefore, to initiate
            the certification process, it is important to consider the
            components that Halal Correct Spain mentions below to determine an
            estimated price.

                Each client has a different manufacturing location. Distance is
                calculated according to the location of Halal Correct Spain's
                headquarters.
              </div>
              <div>
                There are also clients located outside Germany; however, this
                does not imply that the price is much higher. Other components
                influence the fee that is charged. Therefore, location is
                considered one of the factors that affects the fee due to Halal
                Correct Spain's expenses in transportation to reach the company,
                accommodation, audit days and auditor fees.
              </div>
              <div>
                For example, a client located in Germany has much easier access
                than one located in Norway. This will increase travel costs and
                other components mentioned above.

                Some companies have more than one manufacturer or production
                plant. In this case, more time is required to perform the audit.
                This also applies to larger companies, generally
                multinational/international ones.

              <br />
              <div>
                There are 5 categories of products certified by Halal Correct
                Spain HALAL CONFIRMATION CENTER LIMITED: Category CI (Processing
                of perishable animal products), CII (Processing of perishable
                plant products), CIII (Processing of perishable animal and plant
                products (mixed products), CIV (Processing of shelf-stable
                products), CV (Animal slaughter), K (Production of
                (bio)chemicals). Categories CV and CI may have a much higher fee
                because post-audit activities could exist. Processed meat
                products and animal slaughter could require additional
                inspection, meaning it would not only take a common one or two
                day audit. Animal slaughter also requires a slaughterer and
                supervisor during activities. The report must be completed and
                reviewed to ensure all halal requirements are met. Additionally,
                various companies intend to certify batch production; this type
                of certification has a different cost (for each batch).

              <div>
                Halal correct Spain may have high-risk companies that generally
                require additional inspection. Inspection is necessary to
                supervise the company and ensure it still applies halal

              <div>
                After submitting the application form and origin verification,
                Halal correct Spain will review and verify products and raw
                materials. Generally, the applicant is asked to send raw
                material specifications, flow diagram (if necessary) and halal
                certificate of raw materials.

              <br />
              <div>
                There are low, medium and high risk companies. High-risk
                companies usually require much more effort, in addition to more
                time for review and audit. They use animal/pork raw materials or
                alcoholic products. Company complexity could affect the
                certification process.

              <br />
              <div>
                For products certified within the country, complexity is lower
                than for export products, especially for exporting the product
                to Gulf countries. The company generally needs a special
                endorsement letter/document for the specific country to which it
                wants to send its products. This endorsement letter will be
                provided by Halal correct Spain.

              <div>
                The administrative assistant must perform other administrative
                procedures. Therefore, a specific fee will be applied for this
                activity. Administrative work is part of the internal process. A
                specific fee will be applied to cover costs from initiation to
                certificate issuance.

              <br />

              <div>
                After the audit, the company usually requests changes to the
                issued certificate. A common request is to add a new raw
                material or product to their halal certificate. Other requests
                may be approval to use new raw materials in halal certified
                products. When the client requests to add a new raw material or
                product to their halal certificate, a new certificate is
                printed. This activity also has a different cost.

              <div>
                Generally, a client has one certificate and all halal certified
                products are mentioned on the annex page; however, other
                companies may do it differently. The client's request requires
                mentioning only one product in one annex. This means that if
                Halal correct Spain clients own around 10 halal certified
                products, approximately 10 annex pages must be created. The
                certification price is affected by this request.
